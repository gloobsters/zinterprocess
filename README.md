# Moved to gloobie
This project has moved to a subproject underneath the gloobie tree.

You can find it under https://github.com/gloobsters/gloobie/tree/mommy/zinterprocess.

# zinterprocess
Zig implementation of YDMS's fork of Interprocess.

https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/interprocess

This repository takes some creative liberties in some areas to make the API easier to use in Zig, so it's not an exact replica. The implementations are compatible, though.
